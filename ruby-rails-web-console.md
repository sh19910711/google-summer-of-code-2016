## 1. Synopsis

Web Console is a debugging tool for the web apps built with Ruby on Rails. In order
to debug the web apps, It provides an interactive Ruby session to the developers.
The console is displayed in the current page of the browser, and its session stores
context of running code of the web app. It allows the developers to debug the web
apps interactively.

This project aims for making a better user experience for Web Console as a whole,
and the main focus is to support "Auto-completion" feature in the console.

[@gsamokovarov](https://github.com/gsamokovarov) took enough time to review my submitting patches, and he gave me many
valuable advices. In the process, I have had many rejects, but thanks to that
I had been able to write a pretty solid code as a whole.
