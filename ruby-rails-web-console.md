## 1. Synopsis

Web Console is a debugging tool for web apps built with Ruby on Rails. In order
to debug web apps, It provides an interactive Ruby session to the developers. The
console is displayed in the current page of the browser, and its session stores
context of running code of the web app. It allows the developers to debug web apps
interactively.

This project aims for making a better user experience for Web Console as a whole,
and the main focus is to support "Auto-completion" feature in the console.
